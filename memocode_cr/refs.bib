 abstract             = {TLA{\thinspace}+{\thinspace} is a formal specification language that is based on ZF set theory and the Temporal Logic of Actions TLA. The TLA{\thinspace}+{\thinspace} proof system tlaps assists users in deductively verifying safety properties of TLA{\thinspace}+{\thinspace} specifications. tlaps is built around a proof manager, which interprets the TLA{\thinspace}+{\thinspace} proof language, generates corresponding proof obligations, and passes them to backend verifiers. In this paper we present a new backend for use with SMT solvers that supports elementary set theory, functions, arithmetic, tuples, and records. Type information required by the solvers is provided by a typing discipline for TLA{\thinspace}+{\thinspace} proof obligations, which helps us disambiguate the translation of expressions of (untyped) TLA{\thinspace}+{\thinspace} , while ensuring its soundness. Preliminary results show that the backend can help to significantly increase the degree of automation of certain interactive proofs.},
